WQD 7005 Alternative Assessment 1
A clear and concise description of the case study, including its objectives, the role of SAS e-Miner, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Prep in the project.

The case study uses an Ecommerce Online Shopping Transaction Dataset. The data was retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset. This study will focus on Data preprocessing which involves data integration and data profiling, then Data Modelling which will focus on Decision Tree and Random Forest model. The tools that have been used in this case study are Talend Data Integration, Talend Data Preparation, and SAS e-Miner.

Talend Data Integration (TDI) is a comprehensive open-source data integration tool designed to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data across various systems. In this project, TDI will extract the data from two csv files into TDI. Then transforms the datasets into one dataset according to this study objectives. Last, the data will be loaded into one CSV file for the next methodology.

Talend Data Prep provides a user-friendly and efficient way to explore, clean, and transform raw data. Data preparation is a fundamental step in data mining, as it directly impacts the quality and effectiveness of the models built during the mining process. Thus, the roles of Talend Data Prep in this case study are to explore, clean, and transform the raw data into quality data.

Roles of SAS e-Miner in this project is to handle missing value and modeling along with the assessment part.

WQD 7005 Alternative Assessment 1

The case study requires finding customer transaction data from an e-commerce website, encompassing various customer attributes and purchase history, and performing Data Mining methodology that excludes data exploration. The objective of this study is to build a predictive model of the subscription status of the customer. The case study uses an Ecommerce Online Shopping Transaction Dataset. The data was retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset. This study will focus on Data preprocessing which involves data integration and data profiling, then Data Modelling which will focus on Decision Tree and Random Forest model. The tools that have been used in this case study are Talend Data Integration, Talend Data Preparation, and SAS e-Miner.

Talend Data Integration (TDI) is a comprehensive open-source data integration tool designed to facilitate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data across various systems. In this project, TDI will extract the data from two CSV files into TDI. Then transforms the datasets into one dataset according to this study objectives. Last, the data will be loaded into one CSV file for the next methodology.

Talend Data Prep provides a user-friendly and efficient way to explore, clean, and transform raw data. Data preparation is a fundamental step in data mining, as it directly impacts the quality and effectiveness of the models built during the mining process. Thus, the roles of Talend Data Prep in this case study are to explore, clean, and transform the raw data into quality data.

SAS e-Miner is a powerful and comprehensive data mining and predictive analytics solution. It is a part of the SAS Analytics platform and is designed to assist in building predictive models and making data-driven decisions. In this project, SAS EM facilitates in handling missing values and data modeling.
